      ai_description: Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT series, Google's Bard, and Baidu's Wenxin Yiyan, are driving profound technological changes. Recently, with the emergence of open-source large model frameworks like LlaMa and ChatGLM, training an LLM is no longer the exclusive domain of resource-rich companies. Training LLMs by small organizations or individuals has become an important interest in the open-source community, with some notable works including Alpaca, Vicuna, and Luotuo. In addition to large model frameworks, large-scale and high-quality training corpora are also essential for training large language models. Currently, relevant open-source corpora in the community are still scattered. Therefore, the goal of this repository is to continuously collect high-quality training corpora for LLMs in the open-source community. Training a chatbot LLM that can follow human instruction effectively requires access to high-quality datasets that cover a range of conversation domains and styles. In this repository, we provide a curated collection of datasets specifically designed for chatbot training, including links, size, language, usage, and a brief description of each dataset. Our goal is to make it easier for researchers and practitioners to identify and select the most relevant and useful datasets for their chatbot LLM training needs. Whether you're working on improving chatbot dialogue quality, response generation, or language understanding, this repository has something for you.

It offers a novel way of interweaving traditional programming with the ability to call LLMs in your code. LMQL goes beyond traditional templating languages by integrating LLM interaction natively at the level of your program code. It allows you to express programs that contain both traditional algorithmic logic and LLM calls, and offers advanced functionality such as multi-variable templates, conditional distributions, constraints, and control flow. With LMQL, you can better control LLM behavior, optimize runtime, and seamlessly use LLMs from various providers. It also provides extensive applications and flexible tooling for a rich development experience.

The goal of LongNet is to enable scaling of sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens without sacrificing performance on shorter sequences. It achieves this by using dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. The library has a linear computation complexity and can be used as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences. Additionally, LongNet''s dilated attention can be seamlessly integrated with existing Transformer-based optimizations. Experiment results show that LongNet performs well on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks, opening up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences.'

      ai_summary: An advanced RAG pipeline Python library for demystifying and simplifying the inner workings of retrieval-augmented generation pipelines
      ai_description: This Python library provides an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for demystifying and simplifying the inner workings of RAG pipelines powered by large language models (LLMs). It allows users to gain transparency into how RAG pipelines function, understand their mechanics, limitations, and costs. The library enables users to build complex question answering systems by providing components such as data warehouses, vector retrieval for finding similar data chunks, and response generation using LLMs. It also highlights the advantages of RAG pipelines, such as up-to-date information and source tracking for accuracy verification. The library specifically focuses on demystifying and simplifying sophisticated RAG pipelines using the example of the Sub-question Query Engine and provides insights into challenges associated with advanced RAG pipelines.

      ai_description: Epsilla is an open-source vector database management system written in C++. It provides a high-performance and cost-effective solution for vector search, bridging the gap between information retrieval and memory retention in Large Language Models. The system offers a full-fledged database management system with familiar concepts such as databases, tables, and fields, where vectors are treated as another field type. Epsilla supports metadata filtering, hybrid search with a fusion of dense and sparse vectors, and built-in embedding support for natural language in and out search experience. It also features a cloud-native architecture with compute storage separation, serverless capabilities, and multi-tenancy. The system has rich ecosystem integrations with LangChain and LlamaIndex. It offers clients in Python, JavaScript, and Ruby, as well as a REST API interface. Epsilla's core is written in C++ and utilizes advanced academic parallel graph traversal techniques for vector indexing, achieving 10 times faster vector search than HNSW while maintaining precision levels of over 99.9%. Developers can interact with Epsilla through a Python client or using Docker for quick setup. Additionally, it provides the option to use Epsilla as a Python library without starting a Docker image.

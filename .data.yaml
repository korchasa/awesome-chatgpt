      description: The project is a WhatsApp bot that integrates OpenAI's GPT and DALL-E 2 to respond to user inputs. Users can interact with the bot through voice messages, which the bot transcribes and then generates a response. The bot runs a real instance of WhatsApp Web via Puppeteer to avoid getting blocked, but the creators cannot guarantee that it won't be blocked as WhatsApp does not officially allow bots or unofficial clients on its platform. Usage of the bot incurs a cost as OpenAI charges for each request.

      ignore: false
      ignore_reason: The project is substantial and contributes significantly to the advancement of multi-modal models, specifically in following instructions and in-context learning, making it relevant to developers and researchers in the field of AI and machine learning.
      category_rationale: The project "Otter" is developed as a multi-modal model based on the open-sourced version of DeepMind's Flamingo, focusing on improved instruction-following and in-context learning abilities. This aligns with creating a specialized language model, as the repository predominantly revolves around the development, training, and benchmarking of the Otter and OtterHD models, as well as data like MIMIC-IT. The project doesn't fit into standard SDKs, libraries, or applications categories; hence, it should be classified as 'Other LLMs, other models, and other not included in other categories.'

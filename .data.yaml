      description: "CipherChat is a sophisticated framework developed to systematically evaluate the generalization capability of safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) when applied to non-natural languages, such as ciphers. This innovative approach addresses an important aspect of LLM interactions with various languages, particularly focusing on the implications of safety alignment beyond typical conversational scenarios. The framework is designed to investigate the effectiveness of safety measures in LLMs when faced with human unreadable ciphers, which can effectively bypass traditional linguistic safety alignments. \n\nBy assuming that human feedback is mostly provided in natural language, the researchers propose that encoding information using ciphers introduces an interesting challenge for LLMs’ safety protocols. The primary method involves initially training the LLM as a cipher expert, where it learns the enciphering and deciphering rules. By transforming input data into ciphers that the LLM can understand, it is possible to ascertain how well the safety measures hold up against manipulative languages. The results from this evaluation process are made available in the form of query-response pairs, which can be loaded with PyTorch for further analysis. Users can engage with the framework through defined arguments that specify various operational parameters such as model name, data path, encoding methods, and instruction types. Furthermore, the research includes practical demonstrations and various studies, such as case studies and ablation studies, which contribute to a comprehensive understanding of this innovative approach towards analyzing LLMs' alignment safety long term. This tool is a significant step in examining the robustness of AI conversational agents against non-standard encoding."
